Thanks for visiting my website. My name is Davit, I am a husband and father of a one year old princess. In my free time I play with my child, read books, go to fitness(I enjoy swimming) and of course travel.

I am passionate about software engineering, leadership, people management and psychology. As a leader and manager I set up an environment and processes based on business situation and needs. By providing a happy working environment I enable teams to achieve goals in a very efficient way. As an engineer I am always striving to find reliable, scalable and maintainable solutions.

In my personal website I am going to publish posts regarding different areas and fields, including mathematics, engineering, management and more. In some cases I have a strong opinion, therefore, I am kindly asking my readers apologies in advance in case you donâ€™t share my thoughts.Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect.
