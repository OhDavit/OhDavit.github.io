Thanks for visiting my website. My name is Davit, I am a husband and father of one year old princess.
On my free time I play with my child, read books, go to fitness(I enjoy swimming) and of course travel.

I am passionate about software engineering, leadership and people management. As a leader and manager I set up an environment and processes based on business situation and needs. By providing happy working environment I enable teams to achive goals in a very efficient way.
As an engineer I am always striving to find reliable, scalable and maintainable solutions.

In my personal web site I am going publish posts regarding different areas and fields, including mathematics, engineering, management and more. In some cases I have strong opinion, therefore, I am kindly asking my readers appoloies in advance in case you don't share my thoughts.

Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect.
